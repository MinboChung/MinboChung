## Introduction
This project was a graduation thesis project at VU Amsterdam which was supervised under Kees Verstoep (VU Amsterdam). Kees was a great supervisor who gave me interest in Data science and always tells me to have fun whenever we end our meetings. Speaking of the topic matter, **OBD2**, from this project's perspective, is **a bluetooth device** that sends ECU data to be able to **analyze** and/or to conduct scientific experiment on **Car movements**.

As a data scientist, I am going to explore possible projects under the topics (HUGE):
- Data mining
- Machine Learning / Deep learning
    - Python, C++, and Julia
- Explanability

## Interesting questions under the aforementioned topics

## Car profile & Raw Data description

## Software / Hardware profiles
